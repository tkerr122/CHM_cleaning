For building masking, I added functionality to "mask_city" for a user created city array, but haven't incorporated that into preprocessing because manual collection of buildings is tough

To-do:
- Change data_folders variable to include building mask tiles, and test the new mask_buildings function
- Figure out how to use a smoothing filter, if needed

Misc notes: 
- Need to edit tile exists error in preprocessing function for planet tiles, currently skips the tile but when I have all the tiles for processing I need to modify to original error handling
- 135 greenred threshold seems good for Dayton OH
