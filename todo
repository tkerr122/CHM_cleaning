For building masking, I added functionality to "mask_city" for a user created city array, but haven't incorporated that into preprocessing because manual collection of buildings is tough

Potential next steps are:
- Intersecting building training shapefile with lidar extent and using that as a mask
- Using our current building map as a mask layer
- Finding a greenred threshold with a tolerable amount of loss and using that as our building masking workflow

Misc notes: 
- Need to edit tile exists error in preprocessing function for planet tiles, currently skips the tile but when I have all the tiles for processing I need to modify to original error handling
